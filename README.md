# Track Your Run
Your personal run keeper & trainer. 

##Introduction:
Track your run takes full advantage of iPhone's software and hardware power and delivers a personal and productive running experience. <br> 
After a workout, track your run will automatically process the data, and use previous workout data to give you some feedback. The more you run with the app, the smarter it gets. As a developer, please help me to refine the algorithms and further develop this product. 

##Functions:
- Track a workout.
- Give you weather information and warning. 
- Store, process the workout data. 
- Use GPS, pedometer, heart rate monitor (from Apple Watch), weather information. 
- Apple Watch extension allows you to run with your watch. 
- Progress & Timeline. (coming soon...)
